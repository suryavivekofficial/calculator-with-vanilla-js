## My process

- I think my code is not that clean, but I'm trying to improve it.
- I felt that the project would be easier and I can do it in a couple of days, but I unable to complete it.
- I used sass instead of directly writing css.
- I used Object Oriented programming for the functionality of the calculator.
- I also learned how to make a toggle switch with just css. Before doing this project I have no idea how to style a radio button into a toggle switch.
- I also learned how to understand other people code as I looked in codepen for the styling of the toggle.
- I also never wrote a readme file before this and I have no idea how to write one.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
